# English Description
This code extracts menstrual-cycle-data from the pdfs
generated by the ovy app.[1]

The target-format is csv, but the basic structure allows for more
formats.

Since some of the string-splitting is hardcoded, It's currently limited to german.
Adaptions to other languages are welcome.

This code is not particularly user-friendly at the moment, suggestions for 
improvement are welcome. Some improvements are designed to be an easy 
entry for newcomers, these are already present in the issue-section.

If you need help running this code, do not hesitate to ask me via
email at aaronwey at posteo.de, I will help you or run the code for you.

My goal for this project is a drip[2]-compatible csv-output, but other 
formats might be usefull for other users, create an issue for a disscusion.

There are some issues explicitly for someone just starting,
feel free to message me, I will help you out on these.
