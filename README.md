This code extracts menstrual-cycle-data from the pdfs
generated by the ovy app.[1]

It's currently limited to german, but should be easily adaptable to 
other languages.

If you need help running this code, do not hesistate to ask me via
email at aaronwey at posteo.de, I will help you or run the code for you.

This Code is missing some data present in the pdfs,
not quite sure how to improve on that, suggestions are welcome.
